## User Story

` GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city WHEN I open the weather dashboard THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast`

## Technologies

In this application I have use AJAX API calls to request the wether data from **Weather API** using endpoins and update the UI.
**`moment().format(" DD/MM/YYYY");`** format helped configure the date and time.
**`localStorage`** was used to store and retrieve name/value pairs in the web browser.The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
